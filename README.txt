In order to run different tests do the following:
- In your terminal, type the following: 
  TicketSystemTester.py ./InputsAndOutputs/XXXTests/YYYInput.txt results.txt
  In place of YYY please put the name of the input text file
  In place of XXX please put the folder of the test input file you'd like to access

After the test is run, you can view the Daily Transactions in DailyTransactions.txt
which prints the session info

To view the database files (to see if any changes have been made to the databases 
after the session) go to the Database folder. You will find AvailableTickets.txt 
which is the info on the events and UsserAccounts.txt is the user information.
